-The css folder must contain only css files.
-The images in css folder must be in images or assets folder.
- mycss.js is not a proper naming convention try somethin like index.css
 or the name of the section or the page you are styling.
-The jquery folder is redundat the jquery script must be in js folder.
-In the js folder you should either have boostrap bundle js or minified version.
I propose you should use the minified version
- The same applies to the boostrap files.
-  myjava.js is not the proper naming convention try somethin like index.js 
or the name of the script like you did in "gallery.js".
- Javascript script of the owl library is duplicated in multiple files. 
Just make one js script and include it in all html files. key DRY( Don't repeat yourself)
- Avoid importing the scripts and libraries from internet just try to download the files and include 
them in your project.
-  Dont forget to add alt property in the img element. It is good for SEO and screen readers.
